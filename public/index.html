      content="Welcome to our non-profit startup that focuses on collecting e-waste from university and college students across different campuses. Our goal is to provide a convenient and responsible way for students to dispose of their electronic waste while promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness.
      As a university-based non-profit organization, we understand the challenges of responsible e-waste disposal, and we aim to make the process as easy and accessible as possible for students. We provide collection bins on campus, as well as drop-off locations, making it simple for students to recycle their old electronics. We are committed to ensuring that all e-waste we collect is processed in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.
      We work with certified e-waste recycling partners to ensure that all materials are safely and properly disposed of, reducing the negative impact on the environment. By choosing to recycle your e-waste with us, you are not only helping to protect the environment, but also supporting our mission to promote sustainability and responsible waste management practices. Join us in our efforts to make a positive impact on the planet by properly disposing of your electronic waste today!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
